A Framework for Multiple Algorithm Source Separation

The datasets used here are comprised of a source set (SS) convolved through the room impulse response (RIR) set of a particular source/sensor/room geometry (GS) and are detailed in Sect. 5.2 of [1].  A subset of the datasets in [1] is provided here to fulfill the Examples, and the full set is available upon request. All RIRs were artificially generated via [2].
