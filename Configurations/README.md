A Framework for Multiple Algorithm Source Separation

NOTE:
The Configurations in this directory were used to construct all of the figures in Ch. 5 of [1].  However, the development of the framework used a different naming scheme for Configurations than what was necessitated in the writing of [1], e.g. continuity, modularity, etc. This issue would have been rectified quickly at the culmination of development and writing if MatLab had a "refactor" function. I am currently writing a refactor.m function so that I can give all Configurations as they were named in [1], and the next versions of this repo will reflect that. -Keith
